Powerline for Bash in pure Bash script.

## Features

* Git: show branch name, tag name, or unique short hash.
* Git: show "*" symbol with uncommited modifications.
* Git: show "↑" symbol and number of commits ahead of remote.
* Git: show "↓" symbol and number of commits behind remote.
* Kubernetes: Show current-context
* Platform-dependent prompt symbols.
* Color-coded prompt symbol according to previous command execution status.
* Use Bash builtin when possible to reduce delay. Delay sucks!
* No need for patched fonts.


## Installation

Download the Bash script

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riobard/bash-powerline/master/bash-powerline.sh > ~/.bash-powerline.sh

And source it in your `.bashrc`

    source ~/.bash-powerline.sh

To enable `kubectl` context support, add the `POWERLINE_KUBE` variable to your
profile before sourcing the script:

    POWERLINE_KUBE=1
    source ~/.bash-powerline.sh

For best result, use [Solarized
colorscheme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) for your terminal
emulator. Or hack your own colorscheme by modifying the script. It's really
easy.


## Why?

This script is inspired by
[powerline-shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell), which is
implemented in Python. Python scripts are much easier to write and maintain than
Bash scripts, but invoking Python interpreter introduces noticable delay to
draw. I hate delays, so I ported just the part I need to pure Bash script.

The other reason is that I don't like the idea of patching fonts. The
font patching mechanism from the original Powerline does not work with the
bitmap font (Apple Monaco without anti-aliasing) I use on non-retina screens.
I'd rather stick with existing unicode symbols.
